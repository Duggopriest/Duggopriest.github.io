# Artillery
This is a challange designed to test your all round development skills.

the senario:
An artillery crew needs a tool for them to figure out what angle they will have to angle their artillery gun.
there is a satellite above that will provide location data. 
the crew will need a site to access the tool with an input for thier position, the targets position, the velocity of thier shell.
